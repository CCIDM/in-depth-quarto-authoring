# Sample Quarto Document

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. Quarto also allows authors to do literate programming.

These are only a few of the many articles.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

To add a code chunk, press control and "/" simultaneously.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Data Setup

```{r}
#| 
#| 
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
mpg |> 
  #head() |> 
  datatable()
```
