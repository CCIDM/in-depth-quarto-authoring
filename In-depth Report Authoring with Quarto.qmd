# 1. Expected Learning outcomes:

After taking this workshop, participants should be able to:

:::{.small-medium-text .incremental}
1.  Covert students’ existing plain class project report to dynamic HTML report using Quarto. 
2.  Format documents in Quarto with common formatting tasks (e.g., toc, numbering sections, tabsets, citation management, etc.). 
3.  Control the behavior of code blocks for common reports (e.g., hiding/folding code blocks, handling code overflow, handling error, etc.). 
4.  Be familiar with common themes to apply for HTML documents. 
5.  Style your HTML document with SCSS.

# 5. Styling a Standard HTML Report with themes and SCSS with Jarrod

## Using Aside Blocks

Quarto supports “aside” blocks which can be used to provide **additional context** or **tips** without distracting from the main content:

``` markdown
:::{.aside}
*Here’s some extra insight or notes.*
:::
```

::: aside
This is an actual aside block. It won’t disrupt your main slide text!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Creating Styled Divs and Spans

We can **customize layout** by creating styled `div`s or `span`s.

``` markdown
:::{.my-custom-div}
This entire block is wrapped in a custom `div` with a CSS class of `my-custom-div`.
:::
```

For inline styling, you can use a `span` with a class or style attributes:

``` html
<span class="highlighted">Important text here</span>
```

::: {.my-custom-div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;"}
Inside a styled div, we can customize backgrounds, borders, and more.
:::


## Writing LaTeX Equations

You can **embed LaTeX equations** in your Quarto slides using standard LaTeX syntax. For example:

$begin:math:display$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b\^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $end:math:display$

Inline equations are written similarly: $begin:math:display$ E = mc\^2 $end:math:display$

Just place the equations anywhere in your Markdown and Quarto will render them in Reveal.js.


## Making Presentations Self-Contained

By setting `self-contained: true` in your YAML front matter (as done in this file), Quarto **bundles all external resources** (images, CSS, etc.) into a single file. This makes it easy to share or host your presentation without worrying about missing files.

``` yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    self-contained: true
---
```


## Using Code Annotations

Quarto code blocks can include **annotations** to explain specific lines or sections of code:

```{r}
#| label: data-plot
#| annotation: "This code block creates a simple plot in R."

plot(1:10, main = "Example Plot")
```

The `#| annotation:` field allows you to provide short descriptions or notes about the code block’s purpose.



## Enabling the Copy Button for Code Snippets

In your YAML, set:

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    code-copy: true
```

This enables a **copy button** on each code block, allowing you (and your audience) to quickly copy code snippets.


## Exploring Built-in Theme Options

Reveal.js supports **built-in themes** such as:

-   `default`
-   `beige`
-   `solarized`
-   `night`
-   `serif`
-   `simple`
-   and more...

Simply specify a theme name in your YAML:

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: "night"
```


## Defining and Applying Custom Themes

You can define a custom SCSS or CSS theme and reference it in your YAML. For example:

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: 
      - "default"
      - "custom.scss"
```

Where `custom.scss` might contain your **custom styles** to override the default theme.


## Using SASS Variables and CSS for Further Styling

In your custom `.scss` file, you can define SASS variables to make theming more maintainable. For instance:

``` scss
// custom.scss
$bg-color: #2a2a2a;
$font-color: #ffffff;

.reveal {
  background: $bg-color;
  color: $font-color;
}

.my-custom-div {
  border: 2px solid $font-color;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

Then reference `custom.scss` in your Quarto YAML to apply these styles to your presentation.
