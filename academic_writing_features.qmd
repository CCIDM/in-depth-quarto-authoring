# Sample Quarto Document

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. Quarto also allows authors to do literate programming [@erickson2024].[^1]

[^1]: This is just one of many articles about reproducible report.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this[^2]:

[^2]: To add a code chunk, press control and "/" simultaneously.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Data Setup

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mpg
#| tbl-cap: Data Showing mpg related data for automobilies
#| tbl-cap-location: top
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
xmpg |> 
  #head() |> 
  datatable()
```
