# Sample Quarto Document

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. Quarto also allows authors to do literate programming [@erickson2024; @rönkkö2022].[^1]

[^1]: This is just one of many articles about reproducible report.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this[^2]:

[^2]: To add a code chunk, press control and "/" simultaneously.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Exploring Data

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: tbl-mpg
#| tbl-cap: Data Showing mpg related data for automobilies
#| tbl-cap-location: top
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
mpg |> 
  datatable()
```

## Summary of Data

@tbl-mpg shows the interesting data for car-markers. There are `r nrow(mpg)` cars in the data.

## How to Complete Rendering Quarto Files in the Face of an Error

```{r}
xmpg |> 
  datatable()
```

:::{.callout-warning}
There is an error in the file name, `xmpg`. The correct name should be `mpg`. When you cannot fix the error, rendering will stop. If you want to complete the rendering despite an error somewhere in the quarto file, you can add `error: true` to the `YAML` header. See the yaml header under `execute`section.
